                        I am immigrant from Nepal. 
                        I have completed master’s degree in management in 2004. 
                        Since I completed study, I started to work as an accountant in hospitality industry. 
                        My last position in UAE was Asst. Financial controller in Al Safer Group of Companies. 
                        Since I came to Canada I realize without Canadian education outside the country professional 
                        experience is almost zero. Which give me another level of opportunities to compete in the new world. Then I decided to go to school. Due to fastest growing popularity and uses of IT, I decided to join in the IT as a computer programmer analyst T127 and studying in 4th semester at GBC.

                        I was not able to pursue the programming course. After several years of experience in Hospitality industry, I wanted some
                        change in my career. I took this as an opportunity and enrolled in Computer Programmer Analyst program at George Brown College.
