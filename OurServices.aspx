            We believe that a <asp:HyperLink ID="HyperLink1" runat="server" NavigateUrl="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/2017/10/10/private-tutoring-time-invested/" Target="_blank">home tutor and private tutoring</asp:HyperLink>&nbsp;is one of the most efficient ways to learn. 
            For children who may be finding their school work a little too challenging a private tutor will provide
            that individual attention that may just be all they need to excel in that subject. Exam times will always 
            be stressful, but private tuition will help you maintain focus, and exam tutoring could be the difference 
            between scrapping a pass, and distinguishing yourself. If you are starting a new subject from scratch, home 
            tutoring can provide the foundations on to which you can build future knowledge. Remember, private tuition
            is all about you, and we aim to not only help you find the best possible tutor for you,
            but to increase enjoyment in your subject, and build the academic stamina and self discipline that will lead 
            to a successful future both in the academic world and beyond!
            Home tuition and home tutoring are available for adult education too! 
            Adult learning is steadily growing in popularity, and using the services of a private tutor 
            could be a great way to start out or support your adult education!
